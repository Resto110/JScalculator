# JavaScript Functions

In JavaScript, a function serves as a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks. Functions are a cornerstone in JavaScript development, providing a means to organize and structure code efficiently. They enable encapsulation of code segments, allowing developers to assign a meaningful name and invoke or call the function whenever necessary.

## Basic Function Syntax

Here's a fundamental syntax for defining a function in JavaScript:

```javascript
function functionName(parameters) {
    // code to be executed
    return result; // optional, specifies the value to be returned
}
```

**Explanation of the Parts:**
- `function`: Keyword used to declare a function.
- `functionName`: The chosen name for the function, following the same rules as variable names.
- `parameters`: Optional input values that the function can accept; a function can have zero or more parameters.
- `{}`: Curly braces defining the body of the function, containing the code to be executed when the function is called.
- `return`: Keyword specifying the optional value that the function should return; if omitted, the function returns `undefined`.

## Example: Adding Two Numbers

```javascript
function addNumbers(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

// Call the function
var result = addNumbers(3, 5);
console.log(result); // Outputs 8
```

In this example, `addNumbers` is a function that takes two parameters (`a` and `b`), adds them together, and returns the result. The function is then called with the arguments `3` and `5`, and the result is stored in the variable `result`. JavaScript functions play a crucial role in promoting code reuse, modularity, and maintainability.

## `eval(exp)`

The `eval()` function in JavaScript is utilized in this context to dynamically evaluate the value of the expression `exp`. Here's a breakdown:

- **Usage**: `eval(exp)` takes a string (`exp`) as an argument and treats it as JavaScript code, executing the code contained in the string.

- **Purpose**: In the provided code, `eval(exp)` is employed to assess the value of the expression `exp`.

- **Outcome**: If `exp` represents a mathematical expression or valid JavaScript code, the result of its evaluation will be assigned to the 'value' property of the 'textview' input field.

- **Security Considerations**: It's crucial to be aware that using `eval()` introduces security risks, as it opens the door to potential code injection vulnerabilities. Consequently, employing `eval()` is generally discouraged.

- **Best Practices**: Whenever feasible, it is recommended to explore alternative approaches, such as utilizing safer parsing methods or avoiding the use of `eval()` altogether. This helps enhance the security and maintainability of the codebase.

**Note**: The caution against using `eval()` is rooted in its potential to execute arbitrary code, making it susceptible to unintended and potentially harmful consequences. Developers are encouraged to adopt more secure coding practices, especially when dealing with user input or dynamic code generation.

## Understanding `eval()` in JavaScript

In the realm of JavaScript, the `eval()` function plays a pivotal role in dynamically assessing expressions. When we refer to "evaluating the expression," we are describing a process wherein the JavaScript interpreter interprets the provided string as genuine code, leading to the computation of its resulting value. Here's a breakdown:

- **Processing Mechanism**: The JavaScript interpreter processes the given string as executable code.

- **Versatility of Expressions**: The expression subjected to evaluation can encompass a range of possibilities, including mathematical operations, JavaScript code snippets, or any valid expression recognized and executable by the interpreter.

### Example:

```javascript
var result = eval("2 + 3");
// The string "2 + 3" is evaluated as a mathematical expression, and 'result' is assigned the value 5.
```

It's imperative to exercise caution when utilizing `eval()`, especially in scenarios involving untrusted or user-provided input. The ability of `eval()` to execute arbitrary code introduces security risks, making it a feature to be used judiciously or replaced with safer alternatives in certain contexts.

## Universal Selector in CSS

In CSS, the asterisk (`*`) serves as a universal selector. This selector has the ability to target all elements on a web page. Its primary use lies in applying styles globally or resetting styles for all elements.

### Usage Example

```css
* {
  /* Resetting margins and padding for all elements */
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

In this example, the `*` selector is employed to set common styles, such as zeroing margins and padding, across all elements. It's important to use the universal selector judiciously to avoid unintended consequences on specific elements.

# The `<table>` Tag in HTML

The `<table>` tag in HTML is used to create a table. Tables are a way to organize content into rows and columns, making it easier to display and understand structured data. The `<table>` tag is part of a set of tags that work together to define the structure of the table.

## Key Components of the `<table>` Tag:

1. **Table Rows (`<tr>`):**
   - Inside the `<table>` element, you define rows using the `<tr>` (table row) tag.
   - Each `<tr>` tag contains one or more table cells (`<td>` or `<th>`).

   ```html
   <table>
     <tr>
       <td>Row 1, Cell 1</td>
       <td>Row 1, Cell 2</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>Row 2, Cell 1</td>
       <td>Row 2, Cell 2</td>
     </tr>
   </table>
   ```

2. **Table Cells (`<td>` and `<th>`):**
   - Inside each `<tr>` element, you define cells using the `<td>` (table data) tag for regular cells and `<th>` (table header) tag for header cells.
   - `<th>` is typically used in the first row or first column to represent header cells.

   ```html
   <table>
     <tr>
       <th>Header 1</th>
       <th>Header 2</th>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>Row 1, Cell 1</td>
       <td>Row 1, Cell 2</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>Row 2, Cell 1</td>
       <td>Row 2, Cell 2</td>
     </tr>
   </table>
   ```

3. **Table Head (`<thead>`), Body (`<tbody>`), and Footer (`<tfoot>`):**
   - While not strictly required, tables can be divided into three sections for better structure.
   - `<thead>` contains header content (usually within `<th>` elements).
   - `<tbody>` contains the main content (rows and cells).
   - `<tfoot>` contains footer content.

   ```html
   <table>
     <thead>
       <tr>
         <th>Header 1</th>
         <th>Header 2</th>
       </tr>
     </thead>
     <tbody>
       <tr>
         <td>Row 1, Cell 1</td>
         <td>Row 1, Cell 2</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <td>Row 2, Cell 1</td>
         <td>Row 2, Cell 2</td>
       </tr>
     </tbody>
     <tfoot>
       <tr>
         <td>Footer 1</td>
         <td>Footer 2</td>
       </tr>
     </tfoot>
   </table>
   ```

4. **Table Caption (`<caption>`):**
   - The `<caption>` tag can be used to provide a title or caption for the table.
   - It should be placed immediately after the opening `<table>` tag.

   ```html
   <table>
     <caption>My Table Caption</caption>
     <!-- ... table content ... -->
   </table>
   ```

Tables are commonly used to present data in a structured format, such as spreadsheets, calendars, or lists of items. It's essential to use them appropriately to enhance the accessibility and organization of content on a webpage.

Certainly! Let's break down the conditional check in detail:

```javascript
if ((['=', 'C', 'DEL', '/', '*', '-', '+'].includes(num)) && (!currentExp.match(/\d/))) {
  alert("Please select a number first");
  return;
}
```

This conditional check is executed when a button is clicked, and it checks two conditions:

1. **Check if the clicked button is "=", "C", "DEL", or an operator (`/, *, -, +`):**
   ```javascript
   ['=', 'C', 'DEL', '/', '*', '-', '+'].includes(num)
   ```
   - The array `['=', 'C', 'DEL', '/', '*', '-', '+']` represents a list of special buttons: "=", "C", "DEL", "/", "*", "-", and "+".
   - The `includes()` method checks if the `num` variable (the clicked button) is present in this array.
   - If the clicked button is one of these special buttons, the condition evaluates to `true`.

2. **Check if there is no number in the textview:**
   ```javascript
   (!currentExp.match(/\d/))
   ```
   - `currentExp.match(/\d/)` checks if there is at least one digit (`\d` is a regular expression pattern matching digits) in the `currentExp` string.
   - The `!` in front negates the result, so the condition becomes true if there are no digits in `currentExp`.

Now, the entire `if` statement is true only if both conditions are met:

- The clicked button is "=", "C", "DEL", or an operator.
- There is no digit in the current expression (`currentExp`).

If both conditions are true, the code inside the `if` block is executed:

- Display an alert message: "Please select a number first".
- The `return` statement ends the execution of the `insert()` function, preventing further code from being executed.

In summary, this check ensures that if the user clicks on "=", "C", "DEL", or an operator without having entered any numbers first, an alert is shown, and the function stops further execution.

## 1. Attaching Event Listener to the Input Element:
```javascript
document.getElementById('textview').addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
  // ...
});
```
This code uses `document.getElementById('textview')` to get the reference to the input element with the id 'textview', and then it attaches an event listener for the `keydown` event. This means that when a key is pressed down while the input element is in focus, the specified function will be executed.

## 2. Event Object and Key Detection:
```javascript
var key = event.key;
```
The `event` parameter represents the event object. `event.key` retrieves the key that was pressed during the keyboard event.

## 3. Checking if the Pressed Key is a Number, Operator, or Enter:
```javascript
if (/[\d+\-*/.]/.test(key)) {
  // Prevent the default behavior for all keys except Enter
  if (key !== 'Enter') {
    event.preventDefault();
  }
  insert(key);
} else if (key === 'Enter') {
  // Prevent the default behavior for the Enter key
  event.preventDefault();
  equal();
}
```
This block of code checks whether the pressed key is a digit, an operator, or the Enter key. The regular expression `/[\d+\-*/.]/` checks if the key is a digit or one of the specified operators (+, -, *, /, .). If it is, it calls the `insert()` function with the pressed key. If the key is Enter, it calls the `equal()` function. The `event.preventDefault()` is used to prevent the default behavior of the keys (like navigating to a new line for the Enter key).

# Regular Expression Explanation

Certainly! Let's break down the regular expression `/[\d+\-*/.]/`:

1. `/` and `/`: Delimiters
   - In JavaScript, a regular expression literal is enclosed in forward slashes (`/`). The slashes serve as delimiters to define the beginning and end of the regular expression.

2. `[\d+\-*/.]`: Character Class
   - The square brackets `[]` define a character class, which means "match any single character from the set of characters inside the brackets."

3. `\d`: Digit
   - `\d` is a shorthand character class that matches any digit (equivalent to `[0-9]`).

4. `+`: Plus Sign (as is)
   - The plus sign is treated literally in this context, meaning it will match the plus sign character.

5. `\-\`: Minus Sign
   - `\-` is used to escape the minus sign because in a character class, the minus sign has a special meaning (indicating a range of characters). So, by escaping it with a backslash (`\-`), it is treated as a literal minus sign.

6. `*`: Asterisk (as is)
   - The asterisk is treated literally and will match the asterisk character.

7. `/`: Forward Slash (as is)
   - The forward slash is treated literally and will match the forward slash character.

8. `.`: Period (as is)
   - The period is treated literally and will match the period character.

The entire character class `[\d+\-*/.]` specifies a set of characters that the regular expression is trying to match. In this case, it matches any digit (`\d`), plus sign (`+`), minus sign (`\-`), asterisk (`*`), forward slash (`/`), and period (`.`). This character class is used to check if the pressed key is a digit or one of the specified operators (+, -, *, /, .) in the keyboard event handling logic.

# Shorthand Character Explanation

Certainly! In the context of regular expressions, a "shorthand character" or "shorthand character class" refers to a predefined character class that represents a certain category of characters. It provides a concise way to match common types of characters.

### Selecting and Disabling Buttons in JavaScript

You can use either class or ID to select and disable the buttons in JavaScript. In the provided code, the `getElementById` method is used, which is suitable for selecting a single element by its ID. However, if you want to select multiple elements with a shared class (like 'btn'), you should use `getElementsByClassName` or `querySelectorAll` instead.

In the given case, if each button has a unique ID, you could modify the code to use IDs. For example, if your buttons have IDs like 'btn1', 'btn2', etc., you could access them individually using `getElementById`.

Here's an example using IDs:

```javascript
var buttons = [];
for (var i = 1; i <= numberOfButtons; i++) {
  buttons.push(document.getElementById('btn' + i));
}
```

Replace `numberOfButtons` with the actual number of buttons you have. This assumes that your buttons have IDs in the format 'btn1', 'btn2', and so on.

Remember to adapt the code based on your specific HTML structure and button IDs or classes.

# XMLHttpRequest and Server Request Process

```javascript
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
```

Here, an instance of the `XMLHttpRequest` object is created. The `XMLHttpRequest` object is a built-in JavaScript object that provides an easy way to make HTTP requests to a web server and handle the server's response.

```javascript
xhr.open("GET", "store_expression.php?expression=" + encodeURIComponent(expression) + "&result=" + encodeURIComponent(result), true);
```

The `open` method is called on the `XMLHttpRequest` object to initialize the request. It takes three parameters:

1. **HTTP method ("GET"):** Specifies the HTTP method to be used for the request. In this case, it's a "GET" request. The "GET" method is commonly used for retrieving data from the server.

2. **URL ("store_expression.php?expression=..."):** The second parameter is the URL to which the request will be sent. In this example, it's "store_expression.php" with query parameters appended. The query parameters include the `expression` and `result` values obtained from the JavaScript code.

   - `encodeURIComponent(expression)` is used to encode the `expression` value. This function is necessary to ensure that special characters in the expression are properly encoded for inclusion in a URL.

   - Similarly, `encodeURIComponent(result)` is used to encode the `result` value.

3. **Asynchronous flag (true):** The third parameter is a boolean that specifies whether the request should be asynchronous (`true`) or synchronous (`false`). In this case, it's set to `true` for an asynchronous request. Asynchronous requests allow the JavaScript code to continue executing other tasks without waiting for the server's response.

```javascript
xhr.send();
```

The `send` method is called to send the request to the server. This initiates the actual communication with the server. For a "GET" request, the URL with the encoded query parameters is sent to the server.

After the `send` method is called, the browser starts the process of sending the request to the server. Since this is an asynchronous request, the JavaScript code continues to execute without waiting for the server's response.

In a real-world scenario, you would typically set up event listeners to handle the server's response. Common events include:

- **onload:** This event is triggered when the request completes successfully. You can access the server's response in the `xhr.responseText` property.

- **onerror:** This event is triggered if an error occurs during the request.

- **onreadystatechange:** This event is triggered whenever the `readyState` property changes. You can check the `readyState` to determine the current state of the request.

Here's a simple example of using `onload` to handle the server's response:

```javascript
xhr.onload = function() {
  if (xhr.status >= 200 && xhr.status < 300) {
    // The request was successful
    console.log(xhr.responseText); // Access the server's response
  } else {
    // Handle error
    console.error('Request failed with status ' + xhr.status);
  }
};
```

This example checks if the HTTP status code falls within the range of successful responses (200-299). If it does, it logs the server's response to the console. If there's an error, it logs an error message.
